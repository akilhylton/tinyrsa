# tinyrsa

This may not be the most secure RSA library but it is a RSA library that is tiny.

### Installation
```
cd ~/tinyrsa
python setup.py install
```

### Example


### Only Encryption and Decrpytion?
Yes, tinyrsa is as simple as RSA can get it does: key generation, encryption, and decryption.  
However, tinyrsa doesn't do signing messages or key distribution.

### TODO
- Add support for signing messages
